Glossary
--------

* **algorithm**
  An algorithm is a recipe for how a particular task can be performed.
  An algorithm is not written in a programming language and does not
  deal with how data is stored and retrieved, but focuses on the
  processing. Algorithms cannot be executed by computers.
* **API**
  Application Programming Interface. It defines how other applications
* **Application**
  Computer program to perform a particular task.
* **boolean**
  A variable type of which the value can be only true or false.
* **compiler**
  A compiler is a computer program that converts one programming language
  into a lower level language. Some compiler convert a higher level
  programming language into machine code directly (C++), while others use
  intermediate languages (Java).
* **CPU**
  Central Processing Unity. Also called processor. The CPU performs all
  tasks and calculations in the computer, using memory to store data.
  A CPU performs all tasks in a linear fashion, step by step, one thing
  after another: there is ever only the next instruction, and to remember
  anything, it needs memory. All tasks are performed in simple steps like
  adding up numbers, assigning values to variables, and retrieving larger
  amounts of data from files on external memory (hard disk, solid state
  disks, internet, etc) into internal memory for processing. The
  programming language for the CPU is called machine code.
* **documentation**
  Documentation describes the application. User-oriented documentation
  focuses on what the application does, how it should be used, etc.
  Developer documentation describes what the application is supposed to
  do (the algorithm) and how that was implemented.
* **double**
  See float.
* **dynamic HTML**
  Dynamic HTML refers to the combination of HTML and JavaScript, where
  the JavaScript dynamically changes the HTML depicted by the web browser.
* **float**
  A variable type to capture non-integer numbers. Computer representation
  of non-integer numbers have a predefined precision. Doubles often have
  a higher precision than floats, but also require more memory.
* **for-loop**
  Programming languages have a number of constructs to simplify repetitive
  processes. The for-loop is one of the most important ones, and iterates
  as long as some end condition is not met, normally with a particular
  starting condition, and a change in each iteration. The CPU, however,
  will execute the for-loop in a linear fashion, starting with the
  starting condition, repeating the content of the for-loop, for as long
  as the end condition is not met.
* **function**
  Programming languages have a number of constructs to simplify repetitive
  processes. Functions are constructs that group a number of statements into
  a functional bit. It is comparable to mathematical functions, though not
  exactly the same.
* **HTML**
  HyperText Markup Language is the language used by computers to exchange
  the content of web pages.
* **implementation**
  An implementation is the translation of an algorithm into a particular
  programming language, so that a computer then execute that algorithm.
* **JSON**
  JavaScript Object Notation is a language often used by computers to
  exchange data between web services and JavaScript client code.
* **library**
  Where a function is a group of statements, a library is a group of
  functions. For example, the ops.js library is a group of functions
  to interact with Open PHACTS web services.
* **list**
  A list is a commonly used variable type in programming languages, to
  group together a list of variable values. It can be compared to a
  mathematical vector, which is basically a list of floats.
* **list of lists**
  Because lists can contain also complex variable types, they can also
  contain another list. Of all contained lists are of the same lenght,
  you effectively get a matrix. Therefore, the computer representation
  of a mathematical matrix, is commonly a list of lists of floats.
* **machine code**
  Programming language used to instruct a CPU what computation to
  perform.
* **map**
  A map is another complex variable type, which is a construct where
  each element is a pair of a key and a value. A list only has values
  and no keys. This has the advantage that you can look up elements by
  key values. The JSON structure is based on the map concept. 
* **map of maps**
  Similar to list of lists, a map value can also be another map.
* **memory**
  CPUs use simple operations to change vaiable values. However, a CPU
  has very limited memory (a few registers) and can hold only very few
  values at the same time. Variables as used in programming language
  are stored, instead, in the internal memory. This internal memory is
  allocated by the application, and cleared when the application ends.
  Internal memory is not persistent beyond the time a computer is turned
  on. External memory, such as CDs/DVDs, hard disk, solid state disks,
  memory sticks are persistent, and can be used to store data over a
  longer time.
* **operator**
  An operator is a special kind of function, using a different structure
  where the function parameters can be found after and before the operator.
  Common operators are those for assigning values to variables ('='),
  addition for numbers and concatenation of string (+), etc. An overview
  of JavaScript operators can be found at
  http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp.
* **parameter**
  Functions require input data. This input data is passed to them using
  parameters. The parameters define the variables that are known in the
  function call.
* **Open Science**
  Science in which experiment protocols and results are shared immediately.
* **programming language**
  Language that can be used to instruct a computer to perform a certain task.
* **RDF**
  Resource Description Framework is a particular data model used by the
  Semantic Web.
* **Semantic Web**
  Where the World Wide Web is linked network of web pages, the Semantic
  Web is the equivalent for data.
* **source code**
  A text file containing an algorithm and/or data model written in one or
  more programming languages.
* **statement**
  A statement is the smallest "sentence" of a programming "language". It is
  typically ended by a statement terminator, such as the ';' character in
  JavaScript. Forgetting to add the statement terminator is a very common
  reason source code does not compile: the compiler does not know what the
  source code means.
* **unit testing**
  Testing is important to ensure your code does what you think it does. That
  is, it matches the computed results from the implementation with expected
  results which follow from the algorithm. Unit tests are the smallest possible
  tests, which typically test a single function, and often even a particular
  feature of that function.
* **URI**
  Uniform Resource Identifiers are identifiers with a very specific format.
  Uniform Resource Locators are the most common kind of URIs, and used to
  identify webpages.
* **variable**
  A variable is used in programming languages as link or pointer to a particular
  value. The variable is of a particular data type, such as boolean, number,
  string, list, and map. The value behind a variable can change, it is
  variable, which allows computer programs to process variable input data.
* **variable type**
  The type of a variable indicates what functions and operators can act on
  it. For example, while you can multiply two number values, you cannot
  multiply two strings values.
* **web service**
  A web service is effectively a web location that acts as a function. It
  commonly takes input (parameters), and returns calculation or search
  results. A web services uses common standards for communication. JSON
  is an example data exchange format used by many web services.
