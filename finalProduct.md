# The Final Product

Software is not complete without a release, whether it is open or closed. The code is also relatively clean,
which helps later users (which includes your future self). The follow checks are meant to reflect good practices
of scientific coding. See the [course literature list](https://github.com/egonw/pils/blob/master/index.md#literature).

## Final checking

Make sure your GitHub repo contains these files:

 - [ ] AUTHORS, with everyone who contributed to this repository (in a significant way)
 - [ ] LICENSE, where you indicate under which conditions other can reuse (extend, fix, etc) your code
 - [ ] README, with instructions how to run the code, optionally citing libraries, etc

The `README` can be written as plain text (with `.txt` file extension) or as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)
(with the `.md` file extension) which is easier to read. 

 - [ ] old redundant and temporary test files have been removed
 - [ ] there is a logical folder structure

## Making the release

 * make a release on your GitHub project page
 * from the _assests_ download a .zip or a .tar.gz 
 * this file you upload in the assignment
 * in the comments, you leave the URL to the release page
