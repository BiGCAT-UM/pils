# Programming In the Life Sciences

This is a [MOOC](https://egonw.github.io/pils/) around a six day course on using JavaScript to program the life sciences web, but with a focus on the [Open PHACTS API](https://dev.openphacts.org/).

There is [general information](index.md), but you can also jump in and start at [day 1](day1.md).

Description
-----------

In the life sciences the interactions between chemical entities is of key interest. Not only do these play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, and therefore all cellular processes, they are also one of the primary approaches in drug discovery. Pharmacology is the science studies the action of drugs, and for many common drugs, this is studying the interaction of small organic molecules and protein targets.

And with the increasing information in the life sciences, automation becomes increasingly important. Big data and small data alike, provide challenges to integrate data from different experiments. The OpenÂ PHACTS platform provides web services to support pharmacological research and in this course you will learn how to use such web services from programming languages, allowing you to link data from such knowledge bases to other platforms, such as those for data analysis.
