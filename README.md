# Programming In the Life Sciences

This is an [OER](https://egonw.github.io/pils/) around a six day course on using JavaScript to program the life sciences web, with a focus on the life sciences content in [Wikidata](wikidata.org) and its API.

There is [general information](index.md), but you can also jump in and start at [day 1](day1.md).

## Description

In the life sciences the physical interactions between chemical entities, like genes, RNA, proteins, metabolites, and drugs, is of key interest. Not only do these interactions play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, inhibition of proteins, and they basically define all cellular processes. For example, pharmacology is the science studies the action of drugs on protein, and metabolism, similarly, depends on the interactions of small molecule substrates with enzymes.

With the increasing amount of knowledge and data in the life sciences, automation becomes increasingly important. Big data and small, complex data alike provide challenges to integrate data from different experiments and data sources. Various core life sciences databases provide SPARQL end point to their knowledge, while Wikidata is a spider in this web of semantic data. In this course, you will learn to use how to interact with at least SPARQL endpoints with JavaScript and visualize the results graphically with a library like d3.js or Cytoscape.js.
