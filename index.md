# Programming In the Life Sciences

This is a OER around a six day course on using JavaScript to program the life sciences web, but with a focus on the Open PHACTS API.

Description
-----------

In the life sciences the interactions between chemical entities is of key interest. Not only do these play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, and therefore all cellular processes, they are also one of the primary approaches in drug discovery. Pharmacology is the science studies the action of drugs, and for many common drugs, this is studying the interaction of small organic molecules and protein targets.

And with the increasing information in the life sciences, automation becomes increasingly important. Big data and small data alike, provide challenges to integrate data from different experiments. The Open PHACTS platform provides web services to support pharmacological research and in this course you will learn how to use such web services from programming languages, allowing you to link data from such knowledge bases to other platforms, such as those for data analysis.

Schedule
--------

* Day 1: [Theory and HTML+JavaScript exercises](day1.md)
* Day 2: [Choosing a biological research question and exploring the Open PHACTS API](day2.md)
* Day 3: [Write down flows: data flow and programmatic (web service call) flow](day3.md)
* Day 4: [Implement application](day4.md)
* Day 5: [Implement application](day5.md)
* Day 6: [End presentations and individual assessment](day6.md)

The objectives of the course are:
* to have the ability to recognize various classes of chemical entities in pharmacology and to understand the basic physical and chemical interactions;
* to be familiar with technologies for web services in the life sciences;
* to obtain experience in using such web services with a programming language;
* to be able to select web services for a particular pharmacological question;
* to have sufficient background for further, more advanced, bioinformatics data analyses;
* to be familiar with modern software development practices.

During the practical you will develop a HTML+JavaScript application to answer a selected biological question. This question is determined as part of the practical, based on your own interest, with guidance from the instructor.
